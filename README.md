# NodeJs-Endpoint-Example
simple example of a Node.js endpoint mimicking an interview question I was asked

## Getting Started

### Running locally without Docker Image

All packages used in this example are built in to Nodejs so there are no dependencies.

After [installing Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), you are ready to go.

To run simply execute `node webserver.js` after cloning the repository.

Once the webserver is running on your local machine, go to url [`http://localhost:8080/weather?ID=1`](http://localhost:8080/weather?ID=1) to see the working example.

### Creating Docker Image from Dockerfile

Because the source code is finished and the docker file is complete, you only need to build the image using the docker CLI.

`$ docker build -t chsclarke11/node-web-app .`

Finally, run the image and expose it to port 80 

`$ docker run -p 80:8080 -d chsclarke11/node-web-app`

You can now access the webserver at [`http://localhost/weather?ID=1`](http://localhost/weather?ID=1)

### Pulling Docker Image from Docker Hub

First, pull my image from docker hub.

`$ docker pull chsclarke11/node-web-app`

Run the image and expose it to port 80 

`$ docker run -p 80:8080 -d chsclarke11/node-web-app`

You can now access the webserver at [`http://localhost/weather?ID=1`](http://localhost/weather?ID=1)
