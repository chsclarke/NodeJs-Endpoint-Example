# NodeJs-Endpoint-Example
simple example of a Node.js endpoint mimicking an interview question I was asked

## Getting Started
All packages used in this example are built in to Nodejs so there are no dependencies.

After [installing Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), you are ready to go.

To run simply execute `node webserver.js`

Once the webserver is running on your local machine, go to url `http://localhost/weather?ID=1` to see the working example.
